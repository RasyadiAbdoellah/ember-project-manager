# MyProjectManager
MyProjectManager is my attempt at translating how my wife plans out her projects into a web application. A user can create a project that can be shared or set to multiple owners. A project consists of a start and due date, a list of tasks to be completed, and has logic to send a reminder and summary of the project's status to the user. The tasks that make up a project also have individual start and due dates. A task's start date cannot be before its parent project's start date, and the due date cannot be after its parent project's due date.
